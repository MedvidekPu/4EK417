## Model specification choice methods & extensions to linear models

Model selection  
+ Theoretical approach: specific-to-general, general-to-specific
+ Stepwise model selection

Model selection & regularization  
+ Penalized regression
+ Dimension reduction: PCR & PLS

Moving beyond linearity  
+ Quantile regression (quick repetition)  
+ Polynomial and step regression  
+ Regression splines, smoothing splines    
+ Local regression    
+ Generalized Additive Models (GAM)
