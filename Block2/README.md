## Econometric models: specification choice methods & extensions to linear models

Model selection  
+ Theoretical approach: specific-to-general, general-to-specific
+ Stepwise model selection

Model selection & regularization  
+ Penalized regression
+ Principal component regression (PCR) models

Moving beyond linearity  
+ Quantile regression (quick repetition)  
+ Polynomial and step (piecewise-constant) regression  
+ Regression splines  
+ Smoothing splines  
+ Generalized Additive Models (GAM)
