### Block 1: Data handling in R

+ Importing data from major databases (Eurostat, IMF, Yahoo finance, etc.)
+ Data visualization using `ggplot2`
+ Tidyverse packages `tidyr`, `dplyr`, pipe operator `%>%`
+ Missing data, multiple imputation 

#### Materials for Block 1
- [R](https://www.r-project.org/) / [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/)  
- [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/r/info)  
- [Scripts and datasets for Block 1](https://github.com/formanektomas/4EK417/tree/master/Block1)

### Block 2: Model specification choice methods & extensions to linear models

Model selection  
+ Theoretical approach: specific-to-general, general-to-specific
+ Stepwise model selection

Model selection & regularization  
+ Penalized regression
+ Principal component regression (PCR) models

Moving beyond linearity  
+ Quantile regression (quick repetition)  
+ Polynomial and step (piecewise-constant) regression  
+ Regression splines  
+ Smoothing splines  
+ Generalized Additive Models (GAM)
